La cÃ´te Basque, France

Living in Toulouse, Biarritz and La cÃ´te Basque is my closest spot. Honestly,
it's highly overrated. Either the wind is too high, the swell to dizzy, the tide
too high, the swell too low, the current too strong. And when everything is
fine, it's way too crowdy. And the food and locations are expensive. However,
it's in France, and that's really a great place to visit. I would say Surf is a
bonus for nice travel with friends.

Bali

Too crowdy. And exactly at the opposite of my home - but you probably don't care
of that point. And that's it. The rest is magic. Just the best wave I will have,
if I don't get rich enough to go to the Maldives. Uluwatu or Powerful, long,
frequent, and not that hard, nor specially dangerous.

Peniche, Portugal

Like the Almadies of Dakar, Peniche is a small Presqu'ile. You will have waves
watever is the wind, if the swell is good enough. In the winter, it's for sure,
bt the ocean is pretty cold, and don't expect heat in the houses ðŸ˜…
