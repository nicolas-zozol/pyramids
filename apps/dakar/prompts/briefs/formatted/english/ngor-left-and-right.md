# Ngor Left & Ngor Right — Comprehensive Guide

> TL;DR: Access by boat (≈2,000 CFA each way) from Ngor village or by paddling (15–20 min). Ngor Right is more consistent and often sheltered from the prevailing wind; Ngor Left needs friendlier wind conditions. Reef break, urchins and rocks: booties and a thin wetsuit recommended year‑round.

## Access & Logistics

- Ngor village → Ngor Island by pirogue (≈2,000 CFA per trip; negotiate if you go often) or by paddling (15–20 min). Save energy for the paddle back.
- From Ngor Right you can walk across the island to reach Ngor Left.
- Island surf camps are convenient to choose left/right and to organize boat runs to Vivier/Ouakam. Downside: island isolation—Dakar is much livelier.

## Conditions & How It Works

- Ngor Right: more consistent, often sheltered from dominant winds by the island; generally better‑shaped waves.
- Ngor Left: works when wind is favorable (less frequent). Reef break with punchier sections; presence of urchins.
- Iconic: Ngor Right is featured in "Endless Summer." Powerful and hollow, with rocks (“Papi” and “Mami”) nearby.

## Safety, Gear & Level

- Hazards: rocks, urchins; manage entry/exit carefully.
- Gear: thin wetsuit all year (sun protection + light warmth), booties essential; helmet recommended.
- Level: intermediate to expert depending on size/power; potentially softer sections down the line (especially at Right).

## Atmosphere & Services

- Tourist‑oriented island: a few hotels/restaurants, surf camps. Fewer options on the village side (beach hygiene is poor; avoid swimming near outflows).

## Practical Tips

- Go early to beat crowds at Right; alternate with Left depending on wind and tide.
- If staying on the island, boat access is handy for Vivier/Ouakam. Otherwise, account for cumulative pirogue costs if surfing frequently.
