# Club Med — Comprehensive Guide

> TL;DR: Technical wave, frequent even on medium swell, but dangerous (rocks/urchins; difficult entry/exit). Isolated zone (abandoned Club Med): favor taxi/driver or don’t surf alone. Intermediate to expert level.

## Conditions & How It Works

- Often working on the south Almadies coast, even when Vivier/Secret don’t.
- Very hollow and powerful; breaks close to rocks.

## Access & Safety

- Isolated area with few shops: parking feels unsafe; risk of being alone in the water.
- Very technical entry/exit: threading between rocks and urchins; waves push toward the rocky shoreline.
- Essential gear: booties + wetsuit; bring a friend.

## Practical Logistics

- Walk from the Almadies (≈20 min) is possible but tiring on the way back.
- Recommended alternative: taxi/driver with a fixed pickup time (avoid rush hours). Keep a trusted number.
- Private driver option (e.g., Max): pricier than a taxi, but air‑conditioned and reliable.

## Level & Crowd

- Intermediate to expert recommended; often few surfers in the water.
