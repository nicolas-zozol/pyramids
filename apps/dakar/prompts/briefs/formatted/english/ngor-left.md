# Ngor Left — Comprehensive Guide

> TL;DR: More wind‑exposed than Right and less frequent, but excellent when conditions align. Reef break with punchy sections and urchins. Access by pirogue (≈2,000 CFA per trip) from Ngor village or by paddling (15–20 min). You can walk across the island to switch to Ngor Right.

## Ngor Village, Island Access and Atmosphere

From the village beach, reach the island by pirogue (around 2,000 CFA per crossing; negotiate if you go often) or by a 15–20 minute paddle—great warm‑up, but save energy for the way back. The village is lively, but water quality on the mainland side is poor, so avoid swimming there. On the island the vibe is more touristic (surf camps, small hotels and restaurants). A key advantage: you can walk from Ngor Left to Ngor Right in just a few minutes.

## Conditions and How Ngor Left Works

Left sits on the more wind‑exposed face and turns on when the breeze drops or shifts favorably (often south to west) and when the swell carries some period. Takeoffs are committed and the wall is quick; the wave can run long if you set high on the peak. As with any reef, reading the markers and placing precisely make all the difference.

## Safety, Gear and Level

Rocky bottom with urchins: watch a full set cycle before paddling out and identify the channel. Strongly recommended: booties and a thin suit year‑round (sun protection + light insulation); a helmet can help depending on tide and size. Best for intermediate to advanced surfers.

## Logistics and Tips

Pick your entry—and especially your exit—on land before you touch the water. If the wind swings onshore, walk across the island to Right, which is generally more sheltered. Island surf camps can organize boat shuttles to other spots (Vivier, Ouakam), but Dakar’s nightlife and restaurants are back on the mainland.
