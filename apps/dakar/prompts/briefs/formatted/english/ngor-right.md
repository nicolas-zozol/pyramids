# Ngor Right — Comprehensive Guide

> TL;DR: The island’s most consistent wave, often sheltered from prevailing winds. Powerful and sometimes hollow, with nearby rocks (“Papi” and “Mami”) and urchins: booties and a thin suit recommended. Access by pirogue (≈2,000 CFA per trip) or by paddling (15–20 min). You can walk across the island to switch to Ngor Left.

## Ngor Village, Island Access and Atmosphere

Take the pirogue from the village beach (around 2,000 CFA per crossing; negotiate if you go frequently) or paddle across in fifteen to twenty minutes—a great warm‑up on the way out and an effort to anticipate on the way back. The village is lively but water quality is uneven; use the embarkation area farther from outflows. The island concentrates surf camps, hotels and restaurants. A practical advantage: it’s a short walk from Right to Left.

## Conditions and How Ngor Right Works

Right is the safe bet. Thanks to the island’s protection, it handles wind better and breaks more regularly than Left. On clean swell the peak sets up in the same place and reels off with beautiful sections, sometimes quite hollow. It’s featured in “Endless Summer,” which says a lot about its potential—but it still demands precise positioning, set reading and good timing.

## Safety, Gear and Level

The reef and urchins require accuracy, especially at low tide. Two rocks nicknamed “Papi” and “Mami” sit near the zone—give them margin. Booties are essential, a thin suit is recommended, and a helmet is useful depending on conditions. Suitable for intermediate to expert surfers depending on size and period.

## Logistics and Tips

Arrive early to avoid crowds, watch a complete set, and identify the channel and impact zone. If the wind turns unfavorable, walk across to Left. Island surf camps can arrange boat missions to Vivier or Ouakam, but if you’re staying in Dakar, account for the cumulative cost of crossings.
