# Secret — Comprehensive Guide

> TL;DR: Family‑friendly, lively Almadies beach. Frequent but short and hollow waves. Tricky entry (urchins/rocks): watch the locals and enter/exit at the same spot. Easy parking and logistics via bars/restaurants and surf camps.

## Vibe & Setting

- Dakar’s “Riviera”: music bars, chic restaurants, lots of people; families and kids in the water. Holiday atmosphere.

## Conditions & How It Works

- Short, hollow wave that’s more technical than it looks. Good frequency.
- Often less competitive than Ngor: more relaxed spirit.

## Access, Entry & Safety

- Tricky entry: a small passage to the left with rocks but fewer urchins. Put your board down early and glide to avoid spines; exit at the exact same spot.
- Hazards: urchins and nearby rocks.

## Logistics

- Plenty of restaurant parking; you can leave a key at a bar/surf camp (plan to consume afterward). Overlook the spot to rest and watch the sets.

## Gear & Level

- Booties strongly recommended; thin wetsuit useful year‑round. Beginner to intermediate depending on size; the compact, hollow nature calls for caution.
