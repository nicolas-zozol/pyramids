# Ouakam — Comprehensive Guide

> TL;DR: World‑class but fickle wave. Needs solid north swell (or well‑angled south). Dangerous near rocks; for experienced surfers only. Taxi in/out recommended; near the mosque.

## Conditions & How It Works

- Fires with solid swell (≈1.2–1.5 m minimum on site); otherwise breaks too close to rocks and becomes unsafe/unsurfable.
- Long, very hollow wave with no forgiving sub‑peaks: takeoff at the main peak.
- The “it never works” myth is exaggerated: in winter you’ll almost certainly get a few days; in summer it’s rare.

## Access & Safety

- Parking is difficult: come by taxi; easy to find one for the return.
- Keys/valuables strategy: scout a small trusted bar/restaurant in advance to leave keys and cash when it’s on. Don’t hide keys on rocks.

## Level & Etiquette

- For experienced surfers only; strong local presence at the peak.
