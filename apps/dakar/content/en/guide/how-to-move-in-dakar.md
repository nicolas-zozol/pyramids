## Before You Land: What to Expect at AIBD

AIBD (the international airport) runs two main immigration lines: one usually
marked for the African community (right), and one for all passengers (left).
After passport control you’ll pass a small, reliable exchange desk to convert
cash to CFA. As a personal reference point, **€1 ≈ 650 CFA** (author’s
benchmark; rates vary).

> **Takeaway**
>
> - Expect two immigration queues; follow signage.
> - Convert a small amount to CFA right after customs if needed.
> - Keep all stubs and baggage tags handy.

## Clearing Immigration, Cash & Connectivity (CFA & SIM)

### Quick CFA exchange

There is a small counter after customs with **sensible, safe rates** for CFA.
Change what you need for taxis and small expenses. Keep receipts.

### SIM & Wi-Fi basics

AIBD Wi-Fi is generally good enough for **WhatsApp**. If you don’t have an
international plan, **disable roaming or remove your SIM** until you decide.
Orange offers a **\~€30 travel option** (author experience). You can purchase a
local SIM later; for arrival logistics, Wi-Fi + WhatsApp usually suffice.

## Retrieving Your Surfboard (Don’t Leave Without Paperwork)

Bags arrive first; **surfboards often come out last** at a separate oversize
point **at the back**. Waiting can be long. If your board **hasn’t appeared
after \~1 hour**, start asking questions.

**Golden rule:** _Do not leave the airport without an official paper stating
your board is pending._

- This document is essential to track your item.
- Expect to **return daily** to check yourself; **don’t rely on a call**.
- Politely **decline offers** from unknown locals to “pick it up for you.”

## AIBD → Almadies: 4 Reliable Ways

It’s not like major airports in Europe/Asia/US — **no on-site car rental
counters**. Taxis vary in quality, and some unlicensed drivers approach
travelers. Below are four options that work, ranked by reliability based on
experience.

| Option                                     | Pros                                                                                     | Cons                                                                     | Best for                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Trusted rental delivery (e.g., “Eric”)** | Car delivered **to the airport**; full control over schedule; flexible for surf missions | Price varies; needs prior arrangement; driving yourself after a flight   | Independent travelers staying several days |
| **Private driver pick-up (e.g., “Max”)**   | **Name sign** at arrivals; least friction; safer than ad-hoc                             | Must schedule; may leave if waiting too long                             | First-timers, board bags, late arrivals    |
| **Hotel transfer**                         | Coordinated by your hotel; predictable                                                   | Price premium; tied to hotel schedule                                    | If you already booked a hotel in Almadies  |
| **Licensed yellow taxi**                   | On-demand; cash; simple                                                                  | Quality varies; **verify license**; French helps; many **don’t use GPS** | Budget travelers used to bargaining        |

> **Timing buffer** If you land at **15:00** and still need to check for a
> board, **book your driver for \~16:15–16:30**. Better that _you_ wait a little
> than the driver leaving for another fare.

**Traffic**: **\~1 hour** with smooth roads; **up to 2 hours** with traffic.

## Getting Around Almadies for Surf

Within central Almadies you can **walk** to several key points — **Ngor**,
**Vivier**, **Secret**, and the **Casino hypermarket** — though longer walks
quickly get sweaty.

**Yango (local ride-hailing)** works well now and is **usually cheaper than
taxis**. Reliability can vary more than Uber; **cash payment** is possible.
Typical wait: **5–10 minutes**. One tip: check Yango’s quoted price **before**
hailing a street taxi — it gives you a **fair baseline** to negotiate. For
instance, if Yango shows **1,500 CFA**, expect a taxi ask of **1,800–2,000 CFA**
for the same ride.

## Advanced Tips, Timings & Safety

- **Language**: French helps for directions and negotiating.
- **Licensing**: Prefer **yellow licensed taxis** if going off-app.
- **Board logistics**: Confirm **roof racks** or **folding seats** ahead of
  time.
- **Cash**: Keep **small CFA bills** ready; not all drivers can break larger
  notes.
- **No-show mitigation**: Message drivers **before** leaving arrivals; after
  **15–20 min** unresponsive, cancel and re-book.
- **Night arrivals**: Pre-arranged driver or hotel transfer reduces friction.
- **Self-drive**: If you opt for a delivered rental, assess **coolant, brakes,
  lights** before leaving; trust your instincts.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Leaving without board paperwork** — it’s the key to retrieval.
2. **Accepting rides from unlicensed strangers** — higher risk, higher price.
3. **Zero buffer time** — plan extra if you’re waiting on oversize items.
4. **Assuming GPS** — many drivers don’t use it; give **clear landmarks**.
5. **Roaming surprises** — disable it if you don’t have a plan; rely on airport
   Wi-Fi.

## FAQ

**How long does it take from AIBD to Almadies?** About **1 hour** with light
traffic; **up to 2 hours** with congestion.

**Can I sort out a SIM at the airport (and still use WhatsApp)?** You can rely
on **airport Wi-Fi** for WhatsApp on arrival. If you don’t have an international
plan, **disable roaming** until you choose one. The author has used an **Orange
option around €30**; details vary.

**My surfboard didn’t arrive. What should I do?** Wait at the **oversize**
point. If it’s still missing after about **1 hour**, **get an official paper**
before leaving. Then **return daily** to check; don’t expect a call, and **don’t
delegate pickup** to an unknown third party.
