## Urchins and rocks

Both Vivier Left and Vivier Right have areas with sea urchins and rocks, so it's important to be cautious when entering the water. Wearing reef booties is recommended to protect your feet from potential injuries.
The water can be shallow in some areas, especially during low tide, so always check the conditions before surfing.
