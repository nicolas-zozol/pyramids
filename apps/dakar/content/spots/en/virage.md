# Virage

## Overview

Between Ngor and Yoff lies a sneaky little option that Dakar surfers keep in their back pocket. Virage is the kind of urban sandbank you check from the car: a quick glance at the lines, a fast park, and you’re in. When the bars align it delivers clean, playful walls with fewer eyes watching than at the headline reefs.

## Access and Flow

Because it sits within the city grid, the last few turns to the beach can be awkward; taxis make the whole errand painless. The neighborhood bars—Copacabana is a local favorite—turn logistics into a pleasure: drop a key, surf your fill, then debrief over a cold drink with your board drying in the sun.

## Conditions and Boards

It’s classic beach‑break strategy here. Watch for how the tide is opening and closing the channels between bars, beware of punchy shorebreak when the energy bumps up, and carry a funboard or shortboard depending on how steep the sections look. Virage rewards being opportunistic—if you’re nearby and the flags look right, you can be in the water in minutes.
