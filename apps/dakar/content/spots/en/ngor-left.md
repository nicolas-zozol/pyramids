Ngor Left is the more wind‑exposed sibling on Ngor Island—a fast, rewarding reef that lights up when the breeze eases and the swell carries some period. You can walk across the island to switch between Left and Right in minutes.

# Ngor Left

Framed by the tiny, touristic island of Ngor, the Left breaks on the face that catches more wind. When the breeze drops or angles favorably, the takeoff stands up crisply and the wall runs with pace, asking for precise positioning and confident rail work. It is less frequent than Right but memorable when it’s on.

## Getting There

Most surfers hop a short pirogue from Ngor village—about 2,000 CFA per crossing, and worth negotiating if you go often. On calmer days, a 15–20 minute paddle doubles as a warm‑up; just save enough in the tank for the return. The village is lively but the mainland beach has uneven water quality, so stick to the embarkation zone. On the island you’ll find small hotels, restaurants, and a couple of surf camps that simplify storage and boat missions.

## When It Works

Left favors light or offshore‑leaning winds (often south through west) and a swell with some period to draw the reef. Tides influence both entry/exit and how much of the reef is exposed. Watch a full set cycle, fix your markers on land, and commit to the correct line from the first stroke.

## Hazards and Safety

This is a true reef with urchins. Choose a clean channel, keep your calves up on the inside, and plan your exit on land before you paddle. If the wind swings onshore or the face turns bumpy, stroll across to Ngor Right, which is usually more sheltered.

## Boards, Gear and Level

Booties are strongly recommended and a thin suit is useful year‑round for sun and light insulation. Intermediates will enjoy longer trims when the period ticks up, while advanced surfers can hunt the tighter pockets around the bowl. A helmet is a sensible extra on lower tides or bigger days.

## Local Vibe and Practical Notes

The island vibe is relaxed; dawn patrols are the surest way to score emptier windows. If you’re stacking sessions, budget for boat crossings, or plan paddle windows around the tide. Keep an eye on the two‑spot dance: when Left softens with tide or wind, Right often improves—and the walk between them takes only a few minutes.
