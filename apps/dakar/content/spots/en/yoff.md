Large, lively beach break with easy logistics. Two main zones (left side easier, right a bit more technical). No rocks or urchins—great to learn and progress.

# Yoff

## Overview

Stretching north of Dakar, Yoff is the city’s big mellow canvas: long sandbanks, multiple peaks, and a rolling rhythm that makes it the most forgiving place to learn or to reset your surfing after heavier reefs. On smaller pulses the inside reforms into smooth, pushy shoulders; when the swell builds, the outer banks light up without losing their friendly read.

## Location and Access

Practicality is Yoff’s superpower. Access is straightforward, parking is rarely a headache, and the neighborhood buzz means there’s always someone around. Regulars often leave a key with a trusted shopkeeper—introduce yourself on a lay day and you’ll have a friendly face watching your things when the tide is right.

## Conditions and Feel

Think beach‑break fundamentals: choose your bank, watch how the tide is shifting the takeoff zone, and be ready to move a little up or down the beach after a few sets. There are no rocks or urchins here, just sand and the occasional punchy shorebreak when the period climbs. It’s the spot you can surf at dawn before work or at sunset with the local kids juggling a football on the beach.

## Boards and Level

A soft‑top or funboard is ideal on typical days, while a shortboard comes alive when the outer bars start to stand up. Beginners to intermediates will feel at home; more experienced surfers use Yoff to sharpen timing and flow between bigger reef days.
