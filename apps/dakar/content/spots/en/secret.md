# Secret

## Overview

Secret is Dakar’s seaside promenade distilled into a surf spot: music floating off the terraces, families strolling between cafés, and a compact little peak that throws more shade than its size suggests. Sets stand up quickly and pinch into short, hollow runners that reward quick decisions and tight lines. On the right tide it becomes a perfect, repeatable sprint—the kind of wave you can lap for an hour and leave with legs shaking.

## Location and Access

Parking is straightforward thanks to the restaurants that line the shore, and most will happily hold a key or a small bag if you plan to grab a drink afterward. Getting in and out is the real test. Watch the locals for a minute and you’ll see the narrow entry channel to the left where the rock is smoother and urchins are sparse. Place your board down early, glide rather than step, and commit to exiting at the exact same spot. A few misplaced strides elsewhere and you’ll meet the spiny residents you were trying to avoid.

## Conditions, Hazards and Gear

The wave is short and punchy with reliable frequency, but it breaks close to shallow reef. Urchins and low‑tide rock heads are the main hazards; a pair of booties and a thin suit make life simpler and protect from both sun and scrapes. Intermediates will find a friendly read on smaller days, while even advanced surfers appreciate how the pocket tightens up when the period nudges higher.

## Local Vibe and After‑Surf

Compared with the competitive packs at Ngor, Secret feels disarmingly relaxed. You’ll still want to take turns and watch the inside, but there’s room for a friendly smile and the occasional gifted wave. Post‑session, the bars perched over the lineup offer a front‑row seat to cheer on the next crew and relive your best two turns over a cold bissap.
