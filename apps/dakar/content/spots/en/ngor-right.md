Ngor Right is the island’s dependable classic—more sheltered from the prevailing winds and famous for its clean, repeatable takeoff. It’s powerful, sometimes hollow, and sits near rocky landmarks known as “Papi” and “Mami,” so accuracy matters. You can walk across the island to Ngor Left when wind or tide favors the other face.

# Ngor Right

Featured in “Endless Summer,” Right is Dakar’s comfortingly consistent reef: the peak sets up in the same place, the shoulder runs with shape, and good sets let you draw long, satisfying lines. On bigger pulses the pocket tightens and the lip hits with intent, revealing the wave’s heavier side.

## Getting There

Reach the island by pirogue from Ngor village (around 2,000 CFA per crossing; negotiate if you’re a regular) or paddle the 15–20 minutes if conditions allow. The village is lively but water quality can be uneven—use the embarkation area farther from outflows. The island clusters small hotels, restaurants and surf camps for easy storage and occasional boat shuttles.

## When It Works

Right benefits from the island’s wind shadow and therefore breaks more regularly than Left. Give yourself time to watch a full set, identify the channel and impact zone, and set markers on shore. Tides influence both entry/exit and how close the impact zone sits to shallow rock.

## Hazards and Safety

Reef, urchins, and the proximity of “Papi” and “Mami” demand precise positioning—especially at lower tides. Keep margin on the inside and avoid getting pinned if a wide set swings.

## Boards, Gear and Level

Booties are essential; a thin suit is recommended year‑round for sun and comfort, and a helmet is useful on heavy or low‑tide days. Suitable for intermediate to expert surfers depending on size and period.

## Local Vibe and Practical Notes

Dawn sessions are the simplest way to avoid the crowds that Right attracts. If wind turns unfavorable, it’s a short walk to Left. If you’re staying on the mainland, budget crossings or cluster sessions to keep costs in check; if you’re on the island, surf camps can arrange shuttles to Vivier or Ouakam when those are firing.
