Technical, powerful wave that often works even on medium swells. Remote, rocky setting with difficult entry/exit and urchins—best for experienced surfers, ideally not alone.

# Club Med

## Overview

Tucked along the southern flank of the Almadies, Club Med is the dependable workhorse that seems to have a pulse when neighboring reefs go quiet. The trade‑off is seriousness: the takeoff wedges up close to rock, the pocket stays steep, and a mistimed kickout can put you uncomfortably near the boulders. On the right swell it is a memorable, high‑definition ride; on the wrong one it is a lesson in humility.

## Location and Access

The former resort area feels remote—no cafés, no foot traffic, just wind in the scrub and the rumble of sets. Parking is possible but leaves your car exposed, and the walk from central Almadies takes around twenty minutes each way. Most regulars coordinate with a trusted taxi or private driver, set a clear pickup time, and avoid rush hours. However you get there, surf with a friend; the isolation that makes the place special also means fewer helping hands if something goes sideways.

## Conditions, Hazards and Gear

This is a powerful, hollow reef that breaks near rock and hosts plenty of urchins. Expect a strong push that can usher you shoreward faster than expected. Booties and a thin suit are not optional; a helmet is a sensible addition on bigger days. The wave suits confident intermediates and experts who are comfortable reading shallow takeoffs and plotting an exit before the first paddle stroke.

## Practical Notes

Keep your driver’s number handy and plan the exit on land before you ever touch water. On high‑energy days, take a full set on the head and watch where the current wants to put you—it’s the best insurance you can buy against an awkward rock dance at the end of your session.
