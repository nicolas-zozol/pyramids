World‑class but fickle reef near the mosque. Needs solid north (or rare south) swell; otherwise breaks too close to rocks and becomes unsafe. Expert surfers only on working days.

# Ouakam

## Overview

When Ouakam wakes up, it resets your idea of what Dakar can deliver. The takeoff is committed, the face stands tall and keeps running, and there is no soft shoulder to retreat to if you hesitate. It is a true reef ledge that rewards clean technique and punishes anything less.

## When It Works

You’ll need real energy from the north—or a rarer, well‑angled south—to drag the peak off the rocks. Think in‑situ heights north of a meter twenty before it becomes truly makeable. In winter, a handful of days will line up almost inevitably; in summer, you’re mostly gambling on a lucky window.

## Location, Access and Etiquette

The break sits by the mosque in a busy, urban setting where parking can be a headache. The easiest approach is by taxi; plan your return ahead of time and save the number. On off days, introduce yourself at a small bar or restaurant so that, when it’s firing, you have a friendly place to leave a key discreetly. Do not stash keys on the rocks—it’s too visible and the tide has its own opinions. In the water, treat the locals with the respect due to a heavy home break, and wait your turn at the main peak.

## Hazards and Skill

The reef is shallow and the lip hits with intent. There are no forgiving second options once you commit. This is an experts’ wave when it’s on; if you’re new to Ouakam, watch a few sets, fix your markers, and start conservatively. A wave here is worth the patience.
