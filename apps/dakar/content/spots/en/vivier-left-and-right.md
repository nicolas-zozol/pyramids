Two complementary waves near Secret. Left features a rocky, urchin‑studded takeoff; Right often works when Left fades. Entries/exits are delicate—consider paddling from Secret (~10 min).

# Vivier Left & Right

## Overview

Tucked just beyond Secret, Vivier splits neatly into a left and a right that trade the spotlight through the tide. The Left stands up over a distinctive rock nub at the peak and offers a punchy takeoff before easing into a trim line; the Right tends to keep delivering when the Left starts to go soft.

## Getting In and Out

You can enter directly at Vivier, but the exits are trickier than they look, especially as the tide drops. Many regulars prefer to launch at Secret, grab a couple of warm‑up waves, and then paddle the ten minutes across to Vivier with fresh arms. Leave valuables with a trusted bar or camp rather than hiding them in the rocks—the tide has a way of erasing clever hiding spots.

## Conditions and Hazards

Both waves respond to north lines and also wake up on the right south window. Often one improves as the other fades; a quick chat with locals will tell you which side pairs better with high versus low that week. The takeoff for the Left sits right by an urchin‑studded outcrop—keep your calves up and your eyes open—and plan your exit on land before the first paddle stroke.

## What to Bring

Booties make a big difference here, and a thin wetsuit is comfortable year‑round. Intermediates will find enough shape to practice timing and placement, while advanced surfers can hunt the tighter pockets when the period runs longer.
