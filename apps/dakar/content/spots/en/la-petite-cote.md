# La Petite Côte

## Overview

South of Dakar, La Petite Côte is where the city exhales into a ribbon of sand and resort towns—Saly, La Somone, Popenguine. It’s not the metronome that Almadies can be, but when banks line up and the wind behaves, you’ll find clean, welcoming peaks and space to share them.

## Getting There

Plan on forty‑five minutes to an hour by road, traffic permitting. Once you’re down on the coast, the distances shrink and the pace drops a few gears.

## Conditions and Boards

These are classic holiday beach breaks: more fickle than Dakar’s reefs, but generous when they switch on. Come equipped for variety—a funboard or longboard for smaller spells, and patience to walk the sand in search of the best bar. What you lose in frequency you gain in a slower, easier rhythm.
