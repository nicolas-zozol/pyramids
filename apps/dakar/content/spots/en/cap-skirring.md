# Cap Skirring (Casamance)

## Overview

Cap Skirring trades city energy for tropical hush: palm‑lined sand, warm water,
and long beaches where the sandbanks do their quiet work between swells. When
conditions align you’ll thread rippable shoulders with only seabirds for
company, and when they don’t, you’ll still be in one of West Africa’s most
relaxing corners.

## Getting There

You can make the journey by bus through The Gambia—budget‑friendly but long—by
coastal boat, or by plane if you value time over scenery. Whichever route you
choose, arrive a little early for logistics and keep your documents handy at
border checks.

## Surf Notes

Forecast data is sparser than in Dakar and local knowledge counts. Ask at your
lodge, walk the beach at different tides, and bring a repair kit and a backup
board if you’re planning to roam. The payoff for the extra homework is solitude
in the lineup and a horizon that feels all yours.
