Ngor Left and Ngor Right are the most iconic reef breaks in Dakar. Right is more consistent and sheltered; Left needs friendlier wind. Expect power, reef and sea urchins—booties and a thin wetsuit year‑round recommended.

# Ngor Left & Right

## Overview

Just off the northern tip of Dakar, the island of Ngor cradles two legendary waves that could not feel more different. Ngor Right, the local favorite, sits in the lee of the island and benefits from extra shelter when the trade winds are up. Sets stand up cleanly on the reef and peel with surprising consistency for West Africa. Around the corner, Ngor Left needs a more forgiving breeze and a touch more energy, but when it’s on you’ll find a fast, satisfying wall that rewards precise positioning.

## Location & Access

Reaching the lineup is part of the charm. Most surfers take a short pirogue from the village beach—expect roughly 2,000 CFA each way and negotiate if you’re making it a daily habit. On calm days a 15–20 minute paddle is perfectly doable and doubles as a warm‑up; just remember you’ll have to make the return with tired arms. Once you’re on the island, it’s an easy walk across to switch from Right to Left, and the small surf camps dotted along the shore keep logistics simple, from board storage to occasional boat shuttles to Vivier or Ouakam. If you prefer Dakar’s nightlife and food scene, stay on the mainland and time your crossings.

## When It Works

Right is the reliable workhorse. It handles prevailing winds better thanks to the island’s protection and breaks on a range of mid‑period swells. Left is pickier, lighting up when wind eases or angles more favorably and when the swell carries a little extra punch. Tides influence both entry/exit and how much of the reef is exposed, so take a moment to watch a full set cycle before paddling.

## Hazards and Safety

This is a true reef environment with urchins and sporadic rock heads—choose your channel carefully and follow the locals’ line. Off Ngor Right, two rock features nicknamed “Papi” and “Mami” sit uncomfortably close to the impact zone on low tide days; give them respectful clearance and avoid getting pinned if a bigger set swings wide.

## Gear, Skill and Vibe

Booties are a smart call, and a thin wetsuit makes sense year‑round for sun protection and a touch of insulation on longer sessions. Intermediates will find forgiving shoulders down the line at Right on smaller days, while experts can hunt inside pockets and draw longer arcs when the period ticks up. Left is more condition‑dependent and rewards quick footwork and confident paddling. Dawn sessions are your best bet to beat the crowd at Right; mind the lineup etiquette, sit wider until you’ve read the takeoff markers, and you’ll slide into the flow quickly.

## Practical Notes

There are a few simple restaurants and rooms on the island, and surf camps can organize strike missions by boat when other spots are firing. Back on the mainland, avoid swimming near the village outflow and stick to the boat channel for clean water. Budget for multiple crossings if you’re stacking sessions—and keep a little extra for a post‑surf plate of thieboudienne before your next paddle.
